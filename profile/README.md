## Chartino Labs 👋

<!--

**Here are some ideas to get you started:**

🙋‍♀️ A short introduction - what is your organization all about?
🌈 Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved?
👩‍💻 Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?
🍿 Fun facts - what does your team eat for breakfast?
🧙 Remember, you can do mighty things with the power of [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)

Chartino Labs is the experimental playground of two Principal-level engineers — Christopher Hart and Andrea Testino — who believe that good engineering should be reusable, well-documented, and community-friendly.

We build tools, frameworks, and insights for modern automation, testing, and networking — with a focus on decoupling our work from proprietary lock-in.

Everything here is open by design: part R&D, part documentation, part digital garage.
